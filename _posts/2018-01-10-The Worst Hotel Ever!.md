這是我當時投訴的文章，那家飯店不只骯髒、有個變態老闆，他們的員工還會欺騙遊客。當時除了po在臉書的Amman expats group、找觀光警察外，我也到booking.com、Airbnb等各大網站投訴，但那些網站也只是給予官方回應，並沒有將這個飯店的網頁拿下。今天（20.12.2017），我再去看他們的booking網頁，這家飯店已經翻修，比之前的狀況好了，但這還是不改變老闆是個噁心變態的事實。不論如何，我還是推薦大家多花一點錢住好一點的飯店。
 
If you're visiting Amman and searching a hotel to stay, you will find Sun Rise hotel as one of the cheapest on the booking.com. As a former worker working there as workaway, I strongly recommend you not to stay in this hotel. I have suffered some days there, and I'm so glad now I'm out that hell. These are the reasons based on my experience and observation  in the hotel. 

1.sexual harassment:

 One night at 22:00 in the living room, the owner Jabar told me he could teach me the bad words in Arabic. Somehow he starting telling me in Jordan women like to find guys licking their pussy, and it's safe and acceptable here. As he was talking, he moved his tongue showing how the guys licking and which disgusted me. I wanted to go back to my room but he wouldn't let me. Because I was searching for an apartment for my boyfriend and I to stay, the owner offered a room we can rent when my boyfriend. And then, he told me he gave me a big favor, and what would I pay as return? Let him joking on me, touch me, kiss me.... i said he can't touch me. He replied, just a little bit on the boobs and just outside, not inside, it's okay. He touched my knees when he was saying this. He was my boss and we were the only one in the living room, i was very scared. I told him ht can't touch me firmly, in the end he said, " I was joking on you! I have wife and family, I won't do anything to you. I fuck my wife everyday, five times a day. My cum flies far away when I come...." he kept asking how was my sex life, and kept saying we were friends we should talk openly. I kept saying I wanted to go back to sleep, but he wouldn't let me go until midnight. From that day on, I was too scared to sleep every night, was frightened that if he enters my room. I moved out as fast as I could. 

 2.Hygiene problems 

When you go to the hotel, you will find two sides of the second floor are different. One has already renovated, one hasn't. The old part is quite crappy, the walls are peeling and the toilet is broken...the rooms are not in a very good condition for staying. Something I will like to tell you is about the sheets. I happened to went up to wash my clothes with the washing machine. The washing machine was 50 or 60 years old, it has no cover, you have to put water in it before starts washing, and you have to unplug it before you take off your clothes or you will get electricity shock. If it's old it's fine, but after I washed my clothes, the water was alll black, somehow some dirty stuff came up from the pipe, and the machine can't rinse the clothes, so the water and detergent are still there after you finishes washing. After that, I washed the clothes myself again. This machine not only washed my clothes but also all of the sheets, beddings and pillow covers here. Imagine how dirty they actually are. Furthermore, the owner is selling and buying birds per month, so there are many birds in cages coming and going. I don't think that is not very hygienic. 

3.Wifi

The wifi is not everywhere in the hotel and it's not stable. The only place in the hotel that has better wifi signal is the living room. It is a place where many people gather around chatting, smoking and praying. In my opinion it's not very pleasant to stay there long.  

 4.noises

 The walls in the hotel are thin, and there are many people visiting the hotel, for example, the whole family, the owner, his wife, his 7 daughters and three sons. The family or other people somtimes stay up late chatting loudly, playing Quran and smoking all night. 
 
5.Room

Maybe some people will just come to the hotel to check before staying. The manager and owner might tell you there is no dormitory left, so you have to take in another room or tell you some excuses that the price is different. It is not always true. The dormitory is empty most of the time and you should always stick to the price you find online. Be aware!

6.service fee

In the hotel, they might be very generous to offer you trips, food delivery service and taxi service...be careful, the services fee is unreasonably high. Once they were selling a trip for 500JD to the guests and they bargained till it's 400JD. Actually, with 400JD, you can travel around the whole country not just a small place.

 
7.Just something out of curiosity 

When I was in the hotel, the manager, the elder son was in love with a girl. He kept telling me she is his first love, and she came into his dreams... somehow other guests heard different story from him that he had a girlfriend before. This interests me a lot.
 
8.Review

One day the manager asked the guest to help them to explain to airbnb about a bad review. The story he told was a couple disobeyed the rule and tried to sleep together in a room, and the hotel stopped them. Because of that they were angry and wrote bad review about them. However, the bad review was just about there was no toilet paper and the room is not clean, which was truth, not some storytelling manager said.
 
If you had a good stay in the Sun Rise Hotel, you are lucky. I am happy for you. If you are thinking about staying in this hotel, again, I highly recommend you pay a bit more in somewhere else. I experienced and see all this, and I truly wish you wouldn't suffer these things like me in that place again. I don't know if the review can last long, maybe they will make some excuses and take this away. If you want, just tell as many friends as you can, don't let them make a mistake like me.
