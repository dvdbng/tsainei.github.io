We were very productive this November. We were busy getting married and looking for a suitable van. Besides, I finished DELE A2 and CCSE exams, which are required for getting Spanish nationality.

💶Expenses:
Total expenses :865.91 euros.

Since we are living in David’s parents’ house, they support us financially. We didn’t spend much this month. The most we spent was the wedding and our second campervan trip.

Wedding: 264.89 euros.
Campervan trip: the rent was 350 euros and others 36.95 euros. Total 386.95 euros.

💻Productivity:

David did well in his job. I taught 18 hours of Mandarin. Because we are moving to a campervan, I decide not to teach more students.

📺TV & Movies:

We watched many Mandarin and Spanish TV series and movies in order to improve our languages. We watched something in english as well.

Mandarin TV series:

👍🏽👍🏽[Three Kingdoms三國](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1514753/?ref_=nv_sr_3)

Now is David’s favorite show. He has learned some ancient words. He likes me calling him 夫君(hubby) , and I ask him to call me 殿下(your highness) instead.

Spanish TV series：

👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽[La Otra Mirada](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7905548/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

My favorite Spanish show in 2018. It is talking about women right. The story is taking place in Sevilla. You can enjoy the great view of the city as well as the great plot. 

👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽[Las chicas de Cables](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5674718/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)(temporada 3)

I watched it only because the I like the actor. The story is dumb.

Spanish movies：

👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽[100 metros](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5089786/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)

It is based on the true story of a Spanish man with Multiple sclerosis who tried to finish an Iron-Man: 3,8 km swimming, 180 km cycling and 42 running. After he received his diagnosis he was told that he would not be able to walk 100 meters within a year. It is a heartwarming story. I was surprised by the acting of Dani Rovira. I thought he could only play comedies, but he totally changed my mind in this movie.

👍🏽[Maktub](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1779826/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2)

A man suffering from mid-aged crisis met a 15-year-old Canarian boy with cancer. The brave boy has changed his life.

English series: 

👍🏽[Santa Clarita Diet](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5580540/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

👍🏽[Elementary](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2191671/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) (season 6)

English movies:

👎🏽[Crazy Rich Asians](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3104988/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)

It was too boring that my mother-in-law fell asleep after seeing it for 20 minutes. The main characters are so bad at speaking Mandarin. It was a pain to listen to their awful pronunciation. Even David speaks better than they!
